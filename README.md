## FQDs, FQTNs, and Taxonomies – Group 2

### Database Governance and Standardization Project

Our group researched how Fully Qualified Domains (FQDs), Fully Qualified Table Names (FQTNs), and Taxonomies help improve database consistency, reusability, and organization.  
We reviewed how T-SQL CREATE TYPE works like the ANSI SQL CREATE DOMAIN command and how both support taxonomy-based database design.  
We also explained how Fully Qualified Table Names maintain clarity and referential integrity across multiple databases and schemas.  
As a team, we created slides and a video presentation showing the real-world value of these concepts in database governance.



### Goals

- Explain the purpose of FQDs, FQTNs, and Taxonomies in relational databases.  
- Review how T-SQL CREATE TYPE relates to the ANSI SQL CREATE DOMAIN standard.  
- Discuss the benefits of using FQDs within a taxonomy for consistency and reusability.  
- Highlight the importance of FQTNs for clarity and scalability across systems.  
- Prepare a 15-minute group video and submit individual notes summarizing each member’s contribution.
